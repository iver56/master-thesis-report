\section{Experiment 4}
In this experiment, the author intends to analyze what NEAT does. TODO

\subsection{Configuration}
TODO Noise to sine tone

\subsection{TODO}
TODO Compare bark similarity with rms+pitch+centroid

TODO Show neural network. Tell that no hidden nodes are actually needed because the same could be achieved without. Maybe some form of regularization (punishment for more complex neural network) could improve this?

Show species graph and discuss deaths and emerging species, correlate with fitness jumps.
