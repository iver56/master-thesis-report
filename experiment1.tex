\section{Experiment 1}
In this experiment, the aim is to find good values for crossover rate and mutation rate.

\subsection{Results and evaluation}
Figure \ref{fig:exp1_heatmap} shows that one should avoid using a high mutation rate and a low crossover rate. Instead, one of the combinations inside the red region should do well. Bear in mind that the differences between pure yellow and lime green are small in this region, and that these small differences are not statistically significant. The variance could be reduced with more runs, but due to computational time, the number of runs per configuration was limited to 150. The yellow spot is probably a good configuration, albeit not necessarily the best. Muration rate = 0.6 and crossover rate = 0.7 are used in the following experiments.
