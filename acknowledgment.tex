\section*{Acknowledgments}
I express gratitude towards my supervisors Ã˜yvind Brandtsegg and Gunnar Tufte for guidance and valuable feedback during this project. I would also like to the Department of Computer and Information Science, NTNU for providing me with a Linux Virtual Machine to run experiments on. Thanks to students at the office and my girlfriend for supporting me and listening to my ramblings about sounds and genetic algorithms. Thanks to Sigve S. Farstad for valuable feedback. Lastly, I would like to thank contributors to the various open source software and libraries that have been used throughout the project.
