\bf Name & \bf Description \\
\midrule
  NodeJS & Used for serving the application and pushing results to the application via websockets whenever new data becomes available \\
\midrule
  AngularJS & Application framework that makes it easy to build Single-Page Applications \\
\midrule
  Angular-material & User Interface (UI) Component framework. Makes it easy to add UI elements, such as buttons and sliders, that look nice and have great usability. \\
\midrule
  Color-brewer & Various sets of colors that are useful for visualizing data \\
\midrule
  Cubism & Time series visualization in the form of horizon charts, which reduce vertical space without losing resolution. This is useful when there are many variables to visualize simultaneously in a limited vertical space. \\
\midrule
  n3-line-chart & Used for line charts and histograms. Is nicely integrated with AngularJS and features some useful interactions. Depends on D3.js \\
\midrule
  NVD3 & Chart components for D3.js. Used for creating stacked area chart (species plot) \\
\midrule
  Debounce, limit & Used for throttling the refresh rate of computationally demanding actions \\
\midrule
  Sigma & Used for visualizing neural networks. Features zooming, panning and rotating. \\
\midrule
  Wavesurfer & Works as an audio player that also visualizes the waveform of the sound that is played. The user can click on the waveform to seek to that position. \\
\midrule
  jQuery & Makes it easier to do Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation \\
